This plugin monitors file system usage. It is timer-driven, plus a wake-up FIFO can be specified.

Options
===
* `paths`: array of strings

  For each of these paths, an information on usage of the file system it belongs to is returned.

* `period`: number

  A number of seconds to sleep before calling `cb` again. May be fractional. Defaults to 10.

* `fifo`: string

  Path to an existent FIFO. The plugin does not create FIFO itself. To force a wake-up, `touch(1)` the FIFO, that is, open it for writing and then close.

`cb` argument
===
A table where keys are paths and values are tables with the following entries:
  * `total`: number of bytes total
  * `free`: number of bytes free
  * `avail`: number of bytes free for unprivileged users
